### New York Emacs Meetup

We're the Emacs meetup in NYC!

We get together once a month or so (we're currently aiming for the first Monday of the month). We have some pizza and drinks and listen to an Emacs-related talk or two. Fun times are had by all.

Talks are recorded. We post the videos on YouTube for streaming. We also release the [videos for download] in a free format.

Announcements of new meetings and talk descriptions are posted on our [meetup.com group]. We also cross-post them here on our blog, if you prefer RSS and/or don't want to get a meetup.com account.

Meetings take place at [thoughtbot]'s NYC office, which is currently located at the WeWork at 54 W. 40th St., right next to Bryant Park. We meet on the 10th floor.

The group is sponsored by [thoughtbot], which provides the pizza, beer, and space.

### Wanna give a talk? <a name="give-a-talk"> </a>

Interested in giving a talk? Perfect, we're looking for speakers! If you have an idea for a talk that the Emacs community would enjoy, let us know! Whether you're re-implementing the elisp garbage collector or you've just got a cool workflow in Org, we'd love to hear from you. Shoot us an [email]!

If you'd like to give a talk, but aren't sure what to talk about, we've got a few [suggestions].

### Who's doing this?

We're [Harry] and [Eric], a couple of developers from [thoughtbot]'s NYC office.
