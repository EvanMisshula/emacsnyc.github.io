### EmacsNYC

We're the Emacs meetup in NYC!

...or we will be, just as soon as we get the first few talks lined up.

Stay tuned, spread the word, and consider [giving a talk](#give-a-talk)!

### Who's doing this?

We're [Harry] and [Eric], a couple of developers from [thoughtbot]'s NYC office.

### What's the plan, then?

We're trying to put together an Emacs user group in New York. There used to be one, but it seems to be [defunct]. =(

Ideally, we'll all get together once a month or so, listen to a talk, eat some pizza, and talk about our favorite editor/shell/browser/religion.

### Wanna give a talk? <a name="give-a-talk"> </a>

Interested in giving a talk? Perfect, we're looking for speakers! If you have an idea for a talk that the Emacs community would enjoy, let us know! Whether you're re-implementing the elisp garbage collector or you've just got a cool workflow in Org, we'd love to hear from you. Shoot us an [email]!
